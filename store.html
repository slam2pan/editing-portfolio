  			<h1>Commissioned Edits</h1>
  			<p>I love to edit videos and I'd be happy to take you on as a client as well! I will edit any footage, although keep in mind that I am mostly a Fortnite/CoD editor. My typical turn around time is within 2 weeks, depending on how long the edit will take as well as my current workload. I prefer clips to be 60 fps and 1920x1080, but can do others. However, keep in mind the edit may not look as good. The video may be uploaded to my channel at my discretion.</p>

   	    	<h2>Montages:</h2>
	  			<p> My price for a montage is <strong>$3</strong> per clip, with a minimum of 5 clips. I will include cinematics, effects, an intro/outro, and anything else to craft a sick montage.</p>

  	 			<h2>Highlight Edit:</h2>
  	   		<p> I will take the raw footage given and put in music to match the clips as well as clean transitions. There will not be any effects added, as to emphasize the clips themselves, and not the skill of the edit. </p>
